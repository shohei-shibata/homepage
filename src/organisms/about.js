                        My name is Shohei Shibata. I'm a web developer currently living in DÃ¼sseldorf with my wife and two boys.<br/>

                        My biggest focus is in creating simple web apps that positively influence people's lives. 
                        If my apps help people to produce, learn, build a community... I'd be a very happy man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there are any projects which I could support you in any way, I'll be excited to hear about it!
