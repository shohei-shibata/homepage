                        My name is Shohei Shibata. Living in DÃ¼sseldorf with my wife and two boys,
                        I code as much as I can outside of my day job responsibility as a mechanical engineer in the automotive industry.

                        My biggest focus is in creating simple web apps that positively influence people's lives. I want to help the web to be useful, rather than distracting or addictive.
