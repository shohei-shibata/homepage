                    <strong>Welcome! My name is Shohei Shibata.</strong><br/><br/>
                    Living in DÃ¼sseldorf with my wife and two boys,
                    I work as a mechanical engineer in the automotive industry during the day,
                    and code in the spare time.
                </p>

                    The most amazing experiences never happen in the computer, at least as far as I know. 
                    That's why my goal is to create non-distracting, minimalistic apps that helps people 
                    do their computer tasks efficiently.
