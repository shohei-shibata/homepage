            <p>
                Living in DÃ¼sseldorf with my wife and two boys,<br/>
                I work as a mechanical engineer in the automotive industry during the day,<br/>
                and code in the spare time.

                Computers can help us to accomplish so many amazing things.<br/>
                But they can also turn us into monitor-staring zombies.<br/>
                My biggest goal is to promote the positive use of the computers and the internet,<br/>
                by making web apps that allow people to do just that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I strive to make programs that are robust and efficient, with a code that is easy to follow.<br/>

            <p>
                Becoming a parent taught me to use my spare time productively.<br/>
                I probably get much more done now than when I was single, when I had all the time in the world!
            </p>
            <p>
                I will always make time for things that I am passionate about.<br/>
                Do you have a possible project that you'd like to discuss with me?
            </p>
