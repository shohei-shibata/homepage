      <p>Welcome to my homepage.</p>
      <p>I am a web developer based in Dayton, Ohio USA. I basically use this website as a sandbox for me to create whatever I felt like making. Hope you'll find something interesting!</p>
      <p>If you'd like to get in touch, the best way is to <Link to="/contact">use the Contact Form</Link></p>
      <p>Also, I run the event listing website, <Link to="https://livejazzdayton.com">Live Jazz Dayton</Link>. If you're a music fan from the Dayton area, definitely check it out!</p>
