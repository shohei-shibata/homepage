When I moved to the US as a 12 year old, I barely spoke a word of English. Going to school was obviously not easy in the beginning. Generally people were polite, and I certainly would not say I was bullied or anything like that. 

What I would say is that I was worried, nervous, and quiet in those days. From the moment I got on the school bus in the morning, until entering through the front door of the apartment in the afternoon, it was like holding my breath.

I would eventually learn the language and get used to the new environment. But, even well before that, the first feeling of belonging came from music. Especially Jazz.

As taking some sort of a music class was a requirement for a 7th grader, I took the band class, and I chose percussion as my instrument. It was all because there was another Japanese kid playing percussion in the band. The reason for picking up the drum sticks doesn't matter though. It was the only class in the day where the language wasn't totally foreign to me. I knew how to read music notes. And more importantly, people understood and appreciated the sound that I was making. That was the polar opposite of what happens when I tried to speak English, which would be, that I would butcher most of what I wanted to say, and I see question marks over the heads of the people I was trying to communicate to. Each conversation coming to an awkward and embarrassing end.

Soon, I would be taking drum lessons. I would be playing in a band with friends (Japanese friends initially). My drum teacher, Chad Rager, introduced me to a variety of music, including Rock (Led Zeppelin mostly), Funk, Fusion, and Jazz. 

I would practice for hours every day (Sorry parents). Quickly I had become one of the best percussionist in the school band. By the time I entered high school, I would be playing in the Jazz Band at school, along with just about every musical opportunity that is available in school for a drummer.

As you can see, music is what gave me a sense of belonging in a completely new setting. Even today, music gives stability to my life. It's my roots. I would starve without it.

But Jazz, in particular, is home for me. I am open to exploring all kinds of music, but I always come back to it. 

Music is an art form, and it is always about exploring. But while a lot of music out there is trying to expand outward, by looking for new sounds, Jazz explores inward. It seeks what the heart, the soul, is saying. 

In a Jazz setting, each musician is exploring and expressing what they feel. Every other musician is listening, and adding to it their own feelings. When I am fully devoting all my senses to hear what each person is saying and what we are saying collectively as a result... it's just a wonderful feeling.

It is a lot like having a conversation. Except there is never an argument. It's more like a conversation with a good friend you've known for years. Someone who really gets what you are saying.

That, may be what makes a Jazz community so amazing to be a part of. Truly, no matter what your background - rich, poor, and people of all races - are equally appreciated and supported.

And Chick Corea... I don't know that anyone has or will ever enjoy making music as much as he did. Every note that I have ever heard him play was filled with so much joy, and I cannot help but to just soak it in and smile. I imagine that every single time he sat down to play, his number one, and maybe the only one goal, was to have fun with the musicians and the audience. Had he not been so skilled and famous, I think he would have still made music all his life, and perhaps had just as much fun. 

That is really inspiring for me, a non-professional musician, to continue enjoying to practice and have fun making music with whomever I have the opportunity to play. If I am not focused on having fun, and making sure that those around me are enjoying themselves, there really isn't a reason for me to be there playing.

Although this article probably just sort of meanders without a particular goal, this, is what comes to my mind when I think of Jazz.
