# About Me

Hello from Dayton, Ohio!

I'm Shohei, a self-taught web developer. I work full-time as a mechanical engineer, but I really enjoy coding and building websites whenever I can find the time. But my real passion lies in connecting with nature. I am learning all kinds of things about gardening, and doing so in the most natural way possible.

Here on this blog I hope to share the things I learned about web development, lessons from life outside of coding, random thoughts, and anything else that I decide to share with the internet.

If you find a thing or two here that was helpful or entertaining, then my mission for this website is accomplished.

Thanks for visiting!
