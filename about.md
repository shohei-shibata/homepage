A self-taught web developer, a musician, a mechanical engineer, who currently battles the rabbits and squirrels daily in the backyard as I march toward my goal of establishing a vegetable garden there. 🌱 🐿

I believe that all the best things in life exist outside of a computer. Websites should do the amazing things they can do, in a way that enhances our lives in the physical world, instead of getting us hooked and spending more and more time in the screen.

Although I have tons of fun coding, my real passion in it comes from the desire to help steer the internet in this direction.
